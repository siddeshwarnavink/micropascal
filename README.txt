micropascal
==========

A tiny ISO 7185 compiler with most of the standard function support.

Motivation
==========

- This is for 'Recreational' and 'Educational' purpose.
- POC of bringing back old codebase to life by writing a compiler.
- My first project for testing clomy.h (https://github.com/siddeshwarnavink/clomy)

Usage
==========

To use this library:
	make
	./mpas examples/01-fibonacci.pas
	./a.out

Goals
==========

- [ ] All Fundamental ISO 7185 features.
- [ ] Macro system.
- [ ] Basic standard library.
- [ ] Adding my own syntax sugars (Probably in separate flag).
